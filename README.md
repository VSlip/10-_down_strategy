# 10%_down Strategy Backtest

This project simulates and evaluates a trading strategy using historical stock market data. The goal is to test the strategy's effectiveness in identifying profitable trading opportunities and optimizing performance.

## Strategy Overview

The trading strategy is built around two main concepts: **price drops** and **momentum recovery**. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### Key Concepts

1. **Tracking Price Drops**:
   - The strategy monitors the stock's price to identify its **highest high**, which is the maximum price reached so far.
   - It calculates how far the current price has dropped from this highest high (as a percentage).

2. **Setting a Threshold**:
   - A predefined percentage drop (e.g., 10%) is used as a trigger. When the stock price drops by this amount, the strategy considers it a potential buying opportunity.

3. **Using Moving Averages for Timing**:
   - The strategy employs an **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** to evaluate the stock's momentum.
   - If the stock price shows signs of recovery (i.e., EMA indicates upward momentum), the strategy executes a **buy trade**.

4. **Exiting the Trade**:
   - After entering a trade, the strategy monitors the EMA for signs of weakening momentum.
   - If the momentum fades (EMA starts to decrease), it exits the trade by selling the stock, securing any gains or limiting losses.

5. **Optimizing Returns**:
   - The script tests various percentage drop thresholds to identify the most profitable configuration.
   - It tracks performance metrics, including individual trade profits and overall account balance growth.

## Purpose

This backtesting script allows investors and traders to simulate how this strategy would have performed in the past using historical stock data. By analyzing the results, users can:
- Understand the strategy's strengths and weaknesses.
- Optimize parameters like the percentage drop threshold.
- Decide if the strategy is suitable for live trading.

## Usage

To run the backtest, follow these steps:
1. Prepare a CSV file containing historical stock data with required columns like `Open`, `Close`, `High`, and `Low`.
2. Configure trade parameters such as the percentage drop threshold and initial account balance.
3. Execute the script and review the generated reports, which include detailed trade logs and performance summaries.

## Results

The following graph shows how the equity (account balance) evolved over time as trades were executed. The x-axis represents the number of trades, and the y-axis shows the account balance:
